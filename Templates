[qqq] CPU Upgrade - qqqq

//Descrption
Hello, 

	Hope you're doing great. I'm writing you on behalf of qqqq. We're planning a CPU upgrade for this year to upgrade our current box to a z15 (probably a T02). We need to know if your product qqqq needs:
	
	1. Any compatibility maintenance to properly run on a z15.
	2. A new license to be applied.
		2.A. If a new license is required, would you kindly provide us the procedure to request one?
		
	We also need to know:
	
	1. Which kind of support you could grant in case this upgrade is performed on a weekend. Do you have 24/7 support?
	2. The best way to reach you in case an ASAP help is needed. Shall we open a sev 1 case? Is there any emergency phone number to call if needed?
	
Thanks a ton in advance.
